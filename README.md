# A guide to wellbeing during the COVID-19 outbreak

> WHO recommendations made simple, in the style of a typical “style guide”.

## Guidelines vocabulary

Each guideline describes either a good or bad practice, and all have a consistent presentation.

The wording of each guideline indicates how strong the recommendation is.

**Do** is one that should _always_ be followed.

**Don't** indicates something you should _never_ do.

> For some cases, _always_/_never_ might be a bit too strong of a word. Guidelines that literally should always/never be followed are rare. On the other hand, you need a really unusual case for breaking a Do/Don't guideline.

**Consider** guidelines should generally be followed. If you fully understand the meaning behind the guideline and have a good reason to deviate, then do so.

**Avoid** indicates something you should _almost_ never do.

**Why?** gives reasons for following the previous recommendations.

## General recommendations

### Referring to people

#### R.01-01

**Do** be empathetic to all those who are affected, in and from any country.

**Don't** attach the disease to any particular ethnicity or nationality.

**Why?** COVID-19 has and is likely to affect people from many countries, in many geographical locations. People who are affected by COVID-19 have not done anything wrong, and they deserve our support, compassion and kindness.

#### R.01-02

**Do** refer to people with the disease as “people who have COVID-19”, “people who are being treated for COVID-19”, or “people who are recovering from COVID-19”.

**Don't** use “COVID-19 cases”, “victims” “COVID-19 families” or “the diseased”.

**Why?** After recovering from COVID-19, people's life will go on with their jobs, families and loved ones. It is important to separate a person from having an identity defined by COVID-19, in order to reduce stigma.

### Gathering information

#### R.02-01

**Avoid** watching, reading or listening to news about COVID-19 that causes you to feel anxious or distressed.

**Consider** seeking information updates at specific times during the day, once or twice.

**Why?** The sudden and near-constant stream of news reports about an outbreak can cause anyone to feel worried.

#### R.02-02

**Do** seek information only from trusted sources. Get the facts; not rumors and misinformation.

**Consider** seeking information so that you can take practical steps to prepare your plans and protect yourself and loved ones.

**Consider** gathering information at regular intervals from the WHO website and local health authority platforms in order to help you distinguish facts from rumors. 

**Why?** Facts can help to minimize fears.

### Assisting others

#### R.03-01

**Do** protect yourself and be supportive to others.

**Consider** checking by telephone on neighbors or people in your community who may need some extra assistance

**Why?** Assisting others in their time of need can benefit both the person receiving support and the helper.

**Why?** Working together as one community can help to create solidarity in addressing COVID-19 together.

#### R.03-02

**Do** honor and support carers and healthcare workers supporting people affected with COVID-19 in your community.

**Why?** Carers and healthcare workers are saving lives and keeping your loved ones safe. 

#### R.03-03

**Do** listen to what carers and healthcare workers have to say.

**Consider** seeking information so that you can take practical steps to support carers and healthcare workers after this crisis.

**Why?** Social and health care systems may be unscientifically funded. This and some other political decisions may have exacerbated this crisis.

## In isolation

### Being social

#### R.04-01

**Do** stay connected and maintain your social networks.

> If health authorities have recommended limiting your physical social contact to contain the outbreak, you can stay connected via telephone, e-mail, social media or video conference.

**Consider** keeping your personal daily routines or creating new routines if circumstances change.

#### R.04-02

**Do** pay attention to your own needs and feelings during this times of stress.

**Consider** engaging in healthy activities that you enjoy and find relaxing.

### Staying connected

#### R.05-01

**Do** reduce long periods of time spent sitting (work, studying, watching TV, reading, or using social media or playing games using screens).

**Consider** taking short 3-5 minute breaks every 20-30 minutes.

**Why?** By just moving around and stretching you can improve your health and well-being.

#### R.05-02

**Do** 3-5 minutes of physical movement, like walking or stretching, several times a day.

**Why?** Physical movement helps ease muscle strain, relieves mental tension and improves blood circulation and muscle activity.

**Why?** Regular physical activity can also help to give the day a routine and be a way of staying in contact with family and friends.

#### R.05-03

**Don't** exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing.

#### R.05-04

**Consider** setting up a regular routine to be active every day.

**Why?** This will help you build a regular routine, and help you adjust to new ways of working, study and family life under COVID-19 restrictions.

> The WHO recommends to adults over 18 years old with good mobility to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity (or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity) physical activity throughout the week, including muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days per week. For more information see the “How much physical activity is recommended?” section of the WHO Q&A “[Be Active during COVID-19](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/be-active-during-covid-19)” page.
